# circuitplayground-soil
Hi there!
This is my moisture soil meter with a circuit playground and circuit python module. 
I think it's a very good start for beginners or fun. Do you remember your last project just for fun?. 
Currently, this moisture meter I using for measure temperature, light, and humidity with my interior plants.
You can start with lights and temperature and for the next goal, you can add some sounds or collect data, etc. 
I've written code with python and the process was very enjoyable.
